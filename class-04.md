In CSS there are several different types of positioning schemes:

Normal flow; Defautl for browsers, block-level element sits on top of the next one. 

Relative positioning; moves elemtns in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

Absolute postioning

Fixed positioning

Floating Elements

Overlapping elements use the z-index property

To do multi-column layouts without floats is done by ausing <div> to rep each column
  
Fixed width layouts; do not change size for user when they decrease or increase size of browser.
Liquid layouts; stretch and contrast to users.
  
A widely used grid layout is called the 960 pixel grid

## What is a function?

Lets you group a series of statements rather than repeating the same statement.

Declaring a function: " To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task
inside the curly braces." (p 90) *reminder, a code block is what is inside the curly braces

-Parameters; when you declare a function, parameters act like variables.

-"The point to remember is that functions store the code required to perform a specific task, and then the script can ask the 
function to perform that task whenever needed." (p 90)

Calling a function; use function name followed by paretheses.

Functions can return more than one value using an array
