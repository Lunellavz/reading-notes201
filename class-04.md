Declaring a function: " To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task
inside the curly braces." (p 90) *reminder, a code block is what is inside the curly braces

-Parameters; when you declare a function, parameters act like variables.

-"The point to remember is that functions store the code required to perform a specific task, and then the script can ask the 
function to perform that task whenever needed." (p 90)
