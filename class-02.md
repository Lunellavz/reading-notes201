HTML AND CSS by Jon Duckett

## Chapter 2

Structral markup:

-HTML has 6 levels of headings (p 43)

< b > for bold

< i > for italics

< sup > is like the carrot of inserting a power to a number, letter, or word.

< sub > will do the opposite of sup

< br / > puts a break in the line and starts a new line

" There are a few elements that do not have any words between opening and closing tags... known as empty elements. " (p 48)

< hr / > creats a line across page3 as well starts a new line in text

Semantic markup:

< strong > will indicate important text and make it bold

< em > will make a text show italic

< s > can create a line through text that is no longer valid

## Chapter 10

For CSS rule, there is 2 parts: selector and declaration

-Selector indicat3es what part of html will be modified and the decloration indicates how it will be styled.

3 things to keep in mind for flowcharts:

Evaluations

Decisions

Loops

== is equal to; 'hello' == 'hello' returns true, anything other thank 'hello' will return as false.

!= is not equal to; 'hello' != "goodbye" returns a true, anything other than 'hello', will return as true.

>, <, greather than or less than

=== is stricly equal to; '3'===3 returns as false, since '3' is a string.

!== strictly not equal to; '3' !== 3 return as true.

>=, <=; greater than or equal, less than or equal.

&& logical and; " if both expressions evaluate to true then the expression returns true. If just one of these returns false, then the expression
will return false." ( p 157)

|| logical or; " if **either** expression evalutes to true, the expression is true. If **both** return false, then its false."

! logical not; "This reverses the state of an expression. If it was false (without the ! before it) it would reutnr true. If the
statement was true, it would return false." !true= false, !flase=true
