Box Dimensions; when you need to make your own dimensions for a box, use width and height.
When using these, use pixels, percentages or ems.

When you need to limit boxes you can use min-width and max-width, as well as min-height and max-height.

When content is overflowing you can use overflow: hidden, or overflow: scroll, (scroll is cooler).

Every box has three properties; border, margin and padding (p 307)

You can use the border-width property with thin, medium and thick. Y9ou can NOT use percentages with border-width
